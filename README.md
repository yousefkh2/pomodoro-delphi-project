# Delphi Pomofocus Clone

## Introduction

This project is a clone of the popular time management web app, [Pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/), built using Delphi. As someone who regularly uses Pomofocus.io for focused work sessions, I decided to recreate its functionality to better familiarize myself with Delphi programming. This application has been a personal project for the past week, allowing me to gain practical experience in the language and the concept of Rapid Application Development (RAD).

## Features

The application includes the following features:

- Standard Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break timers.
- Task addition and management, with the ability to assign estimated Pomodoros per task.
- Persistence of tasks between sessions using CSV file storage (with plans to migrate to a database for enhanced functionality).
- Customizable timer durations for testing and personal preferences.

## Future Enhancements

Plans for future enhancements include:

- Data analytics to identify tasks that consume the most time.
- Grouping tasks into larger projects, similar to Pomofocus.io's premium features.
- Fixing the alarm functionality to cease immediately upon acknowledgment.

## Technical Details

The application leverages various Delphi components and libraries. Key components include:

- `TTimer` for managing countdowns.
- `TListView` for task display and management.
- File I/O for task persistence.

## Challenges and Learnings

Throughout this project, I encountered a few challenges, including familiarizing myself with Delphi and its various libraries. Despite these challenges, I've grown to appreciate Delphi's RAD approach and am eager to explore more complex projects, inspired by a range of project ideas from a recently acquired book.

## Getting Started

To try out this application:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Compile the project using Delphi.
3. Run the application to start managing your Pomodoro sessions.
